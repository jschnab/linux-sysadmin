# Linux system administration memory aids

This repository hosts my personal memory aids for Linux system administration.
I also wrote these documents as a kind of self-taught course to improve myself
in Linux system management.

The document [essential_commands.md](essential_commands.md) focuses on the most
import Linux commands for general and routine operations. I contains all the
sections I wanted to included, although these will probably be improved.

The document [networking.md](networking.md) shows how to use tools that help
manage and troubleshoot network connectivity.
